Mine will be limited storage,for starters I will be using my phone for my web creation until I get save up to get a laptop and will all know that the things we have in our phone are so limited compare to what the laptop will offer 
  Certain this like the storage like i said before 
   The key board on the phone which is not willing wide
   Phone not accepting other wen applications which can actually help me 
 But nevertheless I will scale through all these challenges and emerge a successful web creator and developer</p>
